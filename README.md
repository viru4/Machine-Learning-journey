# Machine Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my step-by-step journey of learning Machine Learning by **building real projects instead of only studying theory**.

My goal is to become industry-ready by combining:

* Concept understanding
* Hands-on coding
* Real dataset analysis
* End-to-end ML projects

---

## 🧠 Current Focus

Learning core Machine Learning concepts and applying them directly to projects.

Topics covered so far:

* Python for Data Analysis
* NumPy & Vectorized Computation
* Pandas Data Processing
* Data Visualization
* Statistics for ML
* Linear Regression
* Scikit-Learn Workflow
* ML Pipeline Basics

---

## 📊 Projects

### 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

An end-to-end ML project analyzing factors affecting student exam scores and predicting performance.

Features:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature relationship insights
* Regression modeling
* Performance evaluation

Project Link:
👉 `projects/student-performance-prediction`

(More projects will be added as I progress)

## 🛠 Skills Being Developed

* Data analysis & interpretation
* Feature engineering
* Model training & evaluation
* Problem solving with datasets
* Writing reproducible ML workflows

---

## 📅 Learning Philosophy

Instead of tutorial-only learning, I follow:

> Learn concept → Apply on dataset → Build project → Improve daily

This helps develop real understanding rather than memorization.

---

## 📌 Future Roadmap

* Multiple regression models
* Classification algorithms
* Model comparison
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Deployment (API / UI)
